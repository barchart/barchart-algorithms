Minimal Perfect Hash Function

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function

This is a simplified copy of the Sux4J implementation of a minimal perfect hash function written by Sebastiano Vigna. (http://vigna.di.unimi.it/)

His implementation contains a lot of heavy lifting and employs a number of additional libraries.  The goal of this module is to provide a light weight implementation with no dependencies.  

I'm also going to work to make the algorithm more transparent so that it's easier to understand how it works.
